# scToxoplasmaCDC

## This page provide instructions for running statistical analysis on scRNA-Seq data of Babesia species. The analysis are as follows:

* Single-Cell RNA-seq data processing
* Single-Cell ATAC-seq data processing
* Pseudo-time analysis
* Fitting gene curves(smoothing splines)
* Marker analysis
* Time-course clustering
* CUT&RN data processing

## Running the code:

To install the code please clone the library by copy pasting the following in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/umbibio/scToxoplasmaCDC.git

## Data availability
The processed data is is available XX and can be used to run the analysis pipeline smoothly and generate the figures in the paper. We suggest that you save the rds folder within the same directory where the code is cloned. Alternatively, change the relative path in the code.
